# CyberMind

CyberMind's goal is to make any data coming into your computer easily
aggregatable. Data-sources are text-notes, emails, photos, voice,
Whatsapp, Signal, ... Every source stays with its own creator but can
be linked with other sources through tags.

Tags are added automatically (for date, place, source),

Roadmap 2017:
- January: write down ideas
- February: implement simple web-client
- March: make usable Android / iOs client
- April: make desktop-app for Windows/Mac/Linux
- Mai: add email plugin
- June: add bookmark/www plugin
